/* 
 * This program interprets melodic lines given in ABC notation as a 
 * chromesthete might. 
 * 
 * A Pitch class will be defined, and will take center stage in the 
 * processing. 
 * 
 * Interpreting a melody in ABC notation will amount to flashing 
 * colored rectangles for the prescribed durations, while sounding 
 * the pitch! The color of the rectangle will correspond to pitch 
 * class. The duration will correspond to the duration of the note. 
 * 
 * For this first version of the program, the duration will be held 
 * constant at one beat. 
 * 
 * Three sorts of images will appear on the screen, the chromesthetic 
 * output box, a text input box, and an error message box. Simplicity 
 * of design is rendered by permitting only one box to be on the screen 
 * at a time. 
 * 
 * ABC represents notes in a manner consistent with these examples: 
 * C, D, E, C D E c d e
